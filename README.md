# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### The purpose of this project is to help Louise visualize campaign outcomes based on the Kickstarter dataset.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
- Used appropriate pivot tables and filters to sort the campaign outcomes. Created a line chart from the pivot table.
- Theater outcome is most successful during the months of May, June, July.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
- Used the COUNTIFS() function to organize data. Used line chart to visualize the relationship between goal amount and project outcome.
- Higher goals lead to higher percentage of failure and lower percentage of success in project outcomes.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
- Too much information to sort through. Using 
- Outcome in numbers don't reflect the true result. Percentage is a better representation of the data.

## Results

- If Louise wants to do a theater campaign; May, June and July are the best months to launch. The next time Louise starts a campaign, she should keep in mind that a very high goal increases the chances of outcome failure. 

- Limitations: The fact that the dataset does not contain the length of the campaign can be a limitation to the results. Louise won't be able to see how close the campaigns got to the goal. The outcome is only reflected as success, fail and cancel. 

- A pivot table with number of backers count and launch month would give Lousie a better idea of when she should start her campaigns.
